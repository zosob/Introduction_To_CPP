# C++ Programming - Beginner Repository

Welcome to the beginner-friendly C++ programming repository! This repository is designed to help new learners understand the basics of C++ through weekly lessons and practical examples.

## Weekly Topics

### Week 3: Branching in C++
In Week 3, we explored the concept of branching, which allows programs to make decisions based on conditions. Topics covered include:
- Introduction to conditional statements
- Using `if` statements to control program flow
- Examples of simple branching logic

### Week 4: Advanced Branching with If-Else
In Week 4, we built upon the basics of branching and introduced more advanced decision-making structures:
- Using `if-else` statements for multiple conditions
- Nested `if-else` statements
- Practical examples demonstrating complex branching logic

## Getting Started
